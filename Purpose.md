#Purpose
Your purpose is to help me complete the design of this langauge so that it is Turing complete, rational, without contradictions, and logical. The programmer must be able to readily and with few lines of code be able to express complicated behaviors. There is an initial attempt at defining some portions of the langauge in the `actly_description.md` file.

You are **always** to present me options, stop, and wait for my decisions when asked to do a task.
