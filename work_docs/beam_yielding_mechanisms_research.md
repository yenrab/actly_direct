# BEAM Yielding Mechanisms Research

## Overview

This document provides detailed research and analysis of BEAM's yielding mechanisms, which are fundamental to the cooperative scheduling model. Yielding allows processes to voluntarily or involuntarily give up CPU control, enabling fair scheduling and responsive system behavior.

## 1. Voluntary Yields (erlang:yield/0)

### Voluntary Yield Concept
- **Explicit yielding**: Process explicitly calls yield function to give up CPU
- **Cooperative scheduling**: Process cooperates with scheduler for fair CPU sharing
- **Immediate effect**: Process is immediately moved to back of ready queue
- **Reduction reset**: Process gets fresh reduction count when rescheduled

### Voluntary Yield Implementation
```
Voluntary Yield Process:
1. Process calls yield() function
2. Save current process context
3. Reset reduction counter to 2000
4. Move process to back of ready queue
5. Schedule next process from queue
6. Process will be rescheduled later
```

### Yield Function Interface
```
Yield Function Signatures:
- yield(): Explicit voluntary yield
- yield_to(pid): Yield and suggest next process to run
- yield_after(reductions): Yield after N reductions
- yield_if_idle(): Yield only if other processes are waiting
```

### Use Cases for Voluntary Yield
- **Long-running computations**: Break up CPU-intensive work
- **Fairness**: Ensure other processes get CPU time
- **Responsiveness**: Prevent blocking the system
- **Cooperative multitasking**: Work with scheduler for optimal performance

### Benefits of Voluntary Yield
- **System responsiveness**: Prevents processes from monopolizing CPU
- **Fair scheduling**: Ensures all processes get CPU time
- **Predictable behavior**: Processes can control their CPU usage
- **Cooperative design**: Works with scheduler for optimal performance

## 2. Reduction-Based Preemption

### Reduction Counting Mechanism
- **Reduction counter**: Each process has a reduction counter (starts at 2000)
- **Decrement on operations**: Counter decreases with function calls, arithmetic, control structures
- **Preemption trigger**: Process is preempted when counter reaches 0
- **Reset on scheduling**: Counter is reset to 2000 when process is scheduled

### Reduction Cost Model
```
Reduction Costs:
- Function call: 1 reduction
- Arithmetic operation: 1 reduction
- Control structure (if, loop): 1 reduction per iteration
- Built-in function: 1-10 reductions (depending on complexity)
- Message operation: 1 reduction
- Memory allocation: 1 reduction
```

### Preemption Process
```
Reduction-Based Preemption:
1. Process executes instructions, decrementing reduction counter
2. When counter reaches 0:
   a) Save process context
   b) Move process to back of ready queue
   c) Reset reduction counter to 2000
   d) Schedule next process
3. Process will be rescheduled later
```

### Preemption Points
- **Function calls**: Each function call is a preemption point
- **Arithmetic operations**: Basic operations are preemption points
- **Control structures**: Loops and conditionals are preemption points
- **Built-in functions**: BIF calls are preemption points
- **Message operations**: Send/receive operations are preemption points

### Benefits of Reduction-Based Preemption
- **Fair scheduling**: All processes get equal CPU time
- **Responsive system**: No process can monopolize CPU
- **Predictable behavior**: Consistent time slicing
- **Efficient implementation**: Low overhead preemption

## 3. Blocking Operation Yields (Receive, I/O)

### Blocking Operations
- **Message receive**: `receive` blocks until message arrives
- **I/O operations**: File, network, or device I/O
- **Synchronization**: Locks, semaphores, or barriers
- **Timer operations**: `sleep`, `delay`, or timeout operations
- **Resource waiting**: Waiting for memory, CPU, or other resources

### Blocking Yield Process
```
Blocking Yield Process:
1. Process encounters blocking operation
2. Save process context
3. Move process to waiting state
4. Add process to appropriate waiting queue
5. Schedule next process from ready queue
6. Process will be woken when condition is met
```

### Message Receive Blocking
```
Message Receive Blocking:
1. Process calls receive(pattern)
2. Check message queue for matching message
3. If message found:
   a) Process message
   b) Continue execution
4. If no message found:
   a) Save process context
   b) Move to waiting state
   c) Add to receive waiting queue
   d) Schedule next process
```

### I/O Operation Blocking
```
I/O Operation Blocking:
1. Process initiates I/O operation
2. I/O operation is asynchronous
3. Process context is saved
4. Process is moved to I/O waiting queue
5. I/O completion will wake process
6. Process continues execution when I/O completes
```

### Wake-up Conditions
- **Message arrival**: Process receives expected message
- **I/O completion**: Asynchronous I/O operation completes
- **Resource available**: Required resource becomes available
- **Timer expiration**: Timeout period ends
- **External signal**: Process receives signal or notification

### Benefits of Blocking Yields
- **Efficient resource usage**: Processes don't consume CPU while waiting
- **Responsive system**: CPU is available for other processes
- **Event-driven**: Processes respond to events and conditions
- **Scalability**: System can handle many waiting processes

## 4. BIF (Built-In Function) Trap Points

### BIF Trap Concept
- **Built-in functions**: System functions implemented in C or assembly
- **Trap mechanism**: BIF calls can trap to scheduler
- **Preemption points**: BIF calls are natural preemption points
- **System integration**: BIFs integrate with scheduler and system

### BIF Trap Implementation
```
BIF Trap Process:
1. Process calls BIF function
2. BIF function checks if preemption is needed
3. If preemption needed:
   a) Save process context
   b) Move process to ready queue
   c) Schedule next process
   d) BIF continues when process is rescheduled
4. If no preemption needed:
   a) BIF executes normally
   b) Process continues execution
```

### Common BIF Trap Points
```
BIF Trap Points:
- erlang:yield/0: Explicit yield
- erlang:send/2: Message sending
- erlang:receive/0: Message receiving
- erlang:sleep/1: Sleep operation
- erlang:spawn/1: Process creation
- erlang:exit/1: Process termination
- erlang:register/2: Process registration
- erlang:unregister/1: Process unregistration
```

### BIF Trap Benefits
- **Natural preemption**: BIF calls are natural preemption points
- **System integration**: BIFs can interact with scheduler
- **Efficient implementation**: Low overhead preemption
- **Flexible control**: BIFs can control preemption behavior

### BIF Trap Implementation
```assembly
// BIF trap implementation
bif_trap:
    // Check if preemption is needed
    ldr x0, [x1, #REDUCTION_COUNT_OFFSET]
    cmp x0, #0
    b.gt bif_continue
    
    // Preemption needed
    bl save_process_context
    bl enqueue_process
    bl schedule_next_process
    ret
    
bif_continue:
    // Continue BIF execution
    // ... BIF implementation ...
    ret
```

## Yield Implementation Mechanisms

### Context Saving and Restoration
- **Register save**: Save all general purpose registers (x0-x30)
- **Stack pointer**: Save current stack pointer
- **Program counter**: Save current program counter
- **Processor state**: Save processor state register
- **Memory barriers**: Ensure memory consistency

### Context Switch Implementation
```assembly
// Save process context
save_context:
    stp x0, x1, [sp, #-16]!
    stp x2, x3, [sp, #-16]!
    // ... save all registers x0-x30
    str sp, [pcb, #PCB_STACK_POINTER]
    str lr, [pcb, #PCB_LINK_REGISTER]
    str pc, [pcb, #PCB_PROGRAM_COUNTER]
    mrs x0, SPSR_EL1
    str x0, [pcb, #PCB_PROCESSOR_STATE]
    ret

// Restore process context
restore_context:
    ldr x0, [pcb, #PCB_PROCESSOR_STATE]
    msr SPSR_EL1, x0
    ldr x0, [pcb, #PCB_PROGRAM_COUNTER]
    ldr lr, [pcb, #PCB_LINK_REGISTER]
    ldr sp, [pcb, #PCB_STACK_POINTER]
    ldp x30, x29, [sp], #16
    ldp x28, x27, [sp], #16
    // ... restore all registers x0-x30
    ret
```

### Queue Management
- **Ready queue**: Processes ready to run
- **Waiting queue**: Processes waiting for conditions
- **I/O queue**: Processes waiting for I/O
- **Timer queue**: Processes waiting for timers

### Queue Operations
```
Queue Operations:
- enqueue_process(process, queue): Add process to queue
- dequeue_process(queue): Remove and return next process
- is_empty(queue): Check if queue is empty
- queue_length(queue): Get number of processes in queue
- move_process(process, from_queue, to_queue): Move process between queues
```

## Preemption Timing and Frequency

### Preemption Frequency
- **Reduction-based**: Preemption every 2000 reductions
- **Time-based**: Preemption every N milliseconds (optional)
- **Event-based**: Preemption on specific events
- **Hybrid**: Combination of reduction and time-based preemption

### Timing Considerations
```
Preemption Timing:
- Too frequent: High overhead, poor performance
- Too infrequent: Poor responsiveness, unfair scheduling
- Optimal: Balance between overhead and responsiveness
- Adaptive: Adjust frequency based on system load
```

### Preemption Overhead
- **Context switch**: ~100-200 CPU cycles
- **Queue operations**: ~10-50 CPU cycles
- **Memory barriers**: ~10-20 CPU cycles
- **Total overhead**: ~120-270 CPU cycles per preemption

### Adaptive Preemption
```
Adaptive Preemption:
1. Monitor system load and responsiveness
2. If system is responsive:
   - Increase reduction count (less frequent preemption)
   - Reduce preemption overhead
3. If system is unresponsive:
   - Decrease reduction count (more frequent preemption)
   - Improve responsiveness
4. If system is stable:
   - Use default preemption parameters
```

3. **Queue management** for ready and waiting processes
4. **BIF trap points** and system integration
5. **Performance optimization** and monitoring
6. **Testing framework** for yield validation

The implementation should start with basic voluntary yielding and gradually add advanced features like reduction-based preemption and BIF trap points.
